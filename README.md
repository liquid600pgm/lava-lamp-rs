# lava-lamp-rs

This is a remake of [lava_lamp.nim][original] in Rust and glium. It was made
primarily to challenge myself and see how much better did I become at low-level
programming over the past year.

I have to say, coding this was fairly easy. The last time I used Rust for
something was October 2018 (I planned to use it for making rapid), and it was a
pain to use, probably because of my fairly low systems/low-level programming
knowledge (back then I was coming with a Java and Lua background). Over the year
I learned to use languages like C, C++, and Nim, and doing so certainly improved
my skills in that area.

_When trying out something new, be it a language, a library, a game, anything,_
_don't try to build a cathedral_, or so they say. Back then, I did not
understand this. Now that I've made that mistake of building a cathedral with
little familiarity, I'll probably never do it again :) Working on a smaller
project like this is way easier and less frustrating.

## Running

```
cargo run --release
```

The program supports several command line options, listed under `--help`.

Special thanks to @devildefu who helped me with some language problems :)
