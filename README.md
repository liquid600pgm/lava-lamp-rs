# lava-lamp-rs

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is a remake of [lava_lamp.nim][original] in Rust and glium. It was made
primarily to challenge myself and see how much better did I become at low-level
programming over the past year.

## Running

```
cargo run --release
```

The program supports several command line options, listed under `--help`.

## Post-mortem

I have to say, coding this was relatively easy. The last time I used Rust for
something was October 2018 (I was planning to use it to make rapid), and it was
a pain to use, probably because of my lacking low-level programming knowledge
(back then I was coming with a Java and Lua background). Over the year I learned
to use languages like C, C++, and Nim, and doing so certainly improved my skills
in that area.

_When trying out something new, be it a language, a library, a game, anything,_
_don't try to build a cathedral_, or so they say. Back then, I did not
understand why. Now that I've made that mistake of building a cathedral with
little knowledge and familiarity, I'll probably never do it again :) Working on
a smaller project like this is way easier and less frustrating.

Special thanks to @devildefu who helped me with some language problems.
